# Backup to USB
A basic tool written in Python that automatically takes a backup of a folder.
## Prerequisites
* [`Progressbar 2`](https://pypi.org/project/progressbar2/). To install it, type "_pip install progressbar2_"

## Usage
Open the back.py file and edit it properly.
Then, every time you want to run the backup just run wrapper.bat (if on Windows) or wrapper.sh (if on UNIX).

> Note: Linux or UNIX in general is not tested at all. Use at your own risk.
